Common Core Topics Across All Three Rounds:

1. Matrix/Array Operations – traversal, submatrix sums, transformations
2. String Processing – counting, mutation, pattern matching
3. Graph Algorithms – BFS/DFS, connected components
4. Greedy – decision making with limited resources
5. Simulation – step-by-step process simulations
6. Introductory Dynamic Programming – basic knapsack or optimization
7. Game Theory – turn-based/gridded gameplay analysis




How to Prep for June 17:

Matrix/Grid Manipulation --> Practice grid walks, submatrix sums, spiral/zig-zag traversal
String Algorithms --> Practice substring counting, edit operations, rotations
Graphs --> Brush up on BFS/DFS traversals and identifying connected components
Greedy --> Try coin-change, scheduling, interval selection problems
Simulation --> Code problems involving robot/grid movement and event simulation
Basic DP --> Simple knapsack, coin change, LIS variants
Game & Combinatorics --> Practice Nim-type logic or simple win/loss determinations
